# Ubuntu-Practice-Images
# This is a collection of cyberpatriot images for linux
# They are very fun 
# I recomend that beginners try the easy image and advanced try the hard/medium image.
# Thanks to Nobody65534 to configuring the scoring engine on all of them and creating the Impossible image.
# Thank you to FWSquatch for the scoring engine
!Warning Do not try the impossible image unless you are a seasoned pro or else you will have a very hard time
